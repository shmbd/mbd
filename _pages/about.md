<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a microbiologist, currently working at the National Institute of Biotechnology (NIB), Bangladesh. My research journey began with microbial fuel cells, but over time, I developed a deep interest in probiotics, antimicrobial resistance, and the application of microbial biotechnology. I’ve led projects on isolating indigenous bacteria with antimicrobial properties, studied the genomic diversity of probiotic strains like 𝑾𝒆𝒊𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒂 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒇𝒖𝒔𝒂, and conducted in vivo trials to test their antidiarrheal efficacy.

My goal is to bridge traditional microbiological approaches with modern genomics to address global health and food security challenges. I value interdisciplinary collaboration, data-driven discovery, and mentoring young researchers.
